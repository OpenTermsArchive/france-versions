**9\. AMAZON SOFTWARE TERMS**

In addition to these Conditions of Use, [the following conditions](#GUID-602FA6E8-D724-4317-89F6-E78834F9BA58__SECTION_D2D21EE9603C485F95E32464E2116341) apply to any software (including any updates or upgrades to the software and any related documentation) that we make available to you from time to time for your use in connection with Amazon Services (the "Amazon Software").

**10\. OTHER BUSINESS**

Parties other than Amazon operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines on this website. In addition, we provide links to the sites of affiliated companies and certain other businesses. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals or the content of their websites. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in these Conditions of Use, the below Conditions of Sale or the Service Terms, Amazon does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and content of all of these or any other third parties. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we may share your information related to those transactions with that third party. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use.

**11\. THIRD PARTY SELLERS AND AMAZON'S ROLE**

Amazon allows third party sellers to list and sell their products at Amazon.fr. In each such case this is indicated on the respective product detail page. While Amazon helps facilitate transactions that are carried out on the Amazon Marketplace, Amazon is neither the buyer nor the seller of the seller's items. Amazon provides a venue for sellers and buyers to negotiate and complete transactions. Accordingly, the contract formed at the completion of a sale for these third party products is solely between buyer and seller. Amazon is not a party to this contract nor assumes any liability arising out of or in connection with it nor is it the seller's agent nor the representative of third party seller. Except stated below in this section, the third party seller is responsible for the sale of the products and for dealing with any buyer claims or any other issue arising out of or in connection with the contract between the buyer and seller. Because Amazon wants the buyer to have a safer buying experience, Amazon provides the Amazon [A-to-z guarantee](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201889250) in addition to any contractual or other rights.

Please note that some third party sellers may be selling as private individuals and not as professional traders. In each case this information is indicated on the Detailed Seller Information page (which you can access by clicking on the seller's name) and is based on information provided by the seller to Amazon. If a seller is not a business, please note that your normal statutory rights under consumer protection laws (for example, 2-year or 3 years warranty rights, depending on the country, and the right to cancel your order without giving any reason within 14 days) will not apply. However, the Amazon A-to-z guarantee and our voluntary 30-day returns guarantee will still apply in this case.

If the third party seller's items are indicated as Fulfilled by Amazon, Amazon will manage the delivery and our customer service will handle any issue related to the order. For more information, specifically on how to resolve disputes in these particular cases, see the help page [Fulfilled by Amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G239KSGYPUFUY8TQ).

If the third party seller's items are not indicated as Fulfilled by Amazon the seller will manage the delivery of your order. For more information see the help page [Ordering from a Marketplace Seller](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GEF528GN65XSJ7V8). The seller will also handle any customer services inquiries, except if it is indicated that customer service is provided by Amazon or if your order is marked with the Amazon Prime badge.

**12\. OUR LIABILITY**

We will do our utmost to ensure that availability of the Amazon Services will be uninterrupted and that transmissions will be error-free. However, due to the nature of the internet, this cannot be guaranteed. Also, your access to Amazon Services may also be occasionally suspended or restricted to allow for repairs, maintenance, or the introduction of new facilities or services. We will attempt to limit the frequency and duration of any such suspension or restriction.

When dealing with business users, Amazon is not liable for (i) losses that were not caused by any fault on our part, or (ii) business losses (including loss of profit, earnings, contracts, expected savings, data, goodwill or superfluous expenditure), or (iii) any indirect or consequential losses that were not foreseeable to you and us when you started using Amazon Service.

We will not be held liable for any delay or your failure to comply with your obligations under these conditions if the delay or failure arises from any cause beyond our reasonable control. This condition does not affect your legal right to receive goods sent and services provided within a reasonable time or to receive a refund if the ordered goods or services cannot be delivered within a reasonable time due to a cause beyond our reasonable control.

The laws of some countries do not allow some of the limitations listed above. If these laws apply to you, some or all of these limitations may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.

Nothing in these conditions is intended to limit or exclude our liability for fraud, or for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct.

**13\. APPLICABLE LAW**

These conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (with the exception of its provisions on conflict of laws), and the application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. If you are a consumer and have your habitual residence in a country of the European Union, you additionally enjoy the protection afforded to you by mandatory provisions of the law of your country of residence. We both agree to submit any disputes arising out of the business relationship between us to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the district of Luxembourg City, which means that you may bring a claim to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with these Conditions of Use in Luxembourg or in the EU country in which you live.

If you would like to bring a matter to our attention, please [contact us](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/contact-us).

**14\. EXPORT CONTROLS**

You agree that you will not export, re-export, or transfer any products (including software or other digital products) that you have purchased on the website to any country, individual, corporation, organization, or entity to which such export is restricted or prohibited by law. For example, economic sanctions and embargoes imposed by the European Union, the United Nations, US Departments of State, Treasury or Commerce, and other government authorities (such as embargoes imposed on specific countries, or economic sanctions imposed on individuals or companies for terrorism or money laundering offences) may prohibit you from taking products to other countries, even for your own personal use, and/or sending products (whether physically by mail or digitally via email or file-sharing) to particular individuals, corporations, organizations or entities. In addition, you agree that you will not purchase any product or service from the website if you are subject to restrictive measures (sanctions).

**15\. AMENDMENTS TO THE CONDITIONS OF USE**

We reserve the right to make changes at any time these Conditions of Use, and any guidelines or policies on the website, for legal or regulatory reasons, to make them clearer or easier to understand, and/or to reflect any changes we make to the Amazon services by posting the updated versions on Amazon.fr, or such other website or application that is used to provide the Amazon Services. Where we make a significant change to these Conditions of Use Amazon will provide reasonable advance notice to you.

You will be subject to the Conditions of Use, and guidelines and policies in force at the time that you use the Amazon Services. You may at any time, cease using any Amazon Services, terminate your Amazon account or the relevant Amazon Services for any reason, including in the event of any changes.

If any of these Conditions of Use is deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.

**16\. WAIVER**

If you breach these Conditions of Use and we take no action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these Conditions of Use.

**17\. CHILDREN**

We do not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18 you may use the Amazon Services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. Products containing alcohol are intended for adults.

**19\. NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF ILLEGAL CONTENT**

If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been infringed and you are eligible for Brand Registry, please sign up to that service and submit your complaint via Brand Registry.

This form may be used to report all types of intellectual property claims including, but not limited to, copyright, trademark, design and patent claims.

Upon receipt of a complaint we may take certain actions, including removing information or an item and termination of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances. All such actions are taken without any admission as to liability and without prejudice to any rights, remedies or defenses, all of which are expressly reserved. This includes forwarding the complaint to the parties involved in the provision of the allegedly infringing content. You agree to indemnify Amazon for all claims brought by a third party against Amazon arising out of or in connection with the submission of a complaint.

**Note on Third Party Seller Listings:** Please keep in mind that Third Party Seller listings are merely hosted on Amazon.fr and are posted solely at the direction of Third Party Sellers who may be contacted via their Seller Information page, accessible from any of their listings.

**ASIN and ISBN-10 Defined:** "ASIN" stands for _Amazon Standard Item (or Identification) Number_ and is a ten (10) character identifier. It can be found below any listing under Product Details.

**20\. NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR NOTIFYING AMAZON OF ABUSIVE OR DEFAMATORY CONTENT**

Because millions of products are listed and thousands of reviews are hosted on Amazon.fr, it is not possible for us to be aware of the contents of each product listed for sale, or all comments or reviews that are posted.

If you believe that any content or listing on the website contains a defamatory message, please notify us immediately by completing the Notice and Procedure for Notifying Amazon of Abusive or Defamatory Content. Follow the instructions in the Notice Form.

**Important Warning:** giving false, misleading or inaccurate information in the Notice Form to Amazon may result in civil and/or criminal liability.

All prices are inclusive of all French taxes (French VAT and other applicable taxes), unless stated otherwise.

The availability of the products we sell on the Website is displayed on each product page. We cannot give any further information about the availability of products other than what is stated on that page or elsewhere on the Website. When processing your order, we will notify you as soon as possible by email using the email address associated with your subscription, or via the Message Center in Your Account, if any of the products you have ordered happen to be unavailable, and we will not charge you for those products.

Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. We will verify pricing when processing your order and before we take payment. If we have made a mistake and a product's correct price is higher than the price on the Website, we may either contact you before dispatch to request whether you want to buy the product at the correct price or cancel your order. If a product's correct price is lower than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount and send you the product.

**5\. CUSTOMS**

When ordering products from Amazon for delivery outside of the EU you may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once the package reaches the specified destination. Any additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you; we have no control over these charges. Customs policies vary widely from country to country, so you should contact your local customs office for further information. Additionally, please note that when ordering from Amazon, you are considered the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which you are receiving the products. Your privacy is important to us and we would like our international customers to be aware that cross-border deliveries are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities. For more information see our page [About Import Fees Deposit](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G8VRJ7Y8Z3T5WPV3).

**6\. BUY NOW**

If you are using a public or shared computer terminal, we strongly recommend that [you deactivate Buy Now ordering](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GDZ8ZNZDSTL6ZYCP) when you are not at the computer.

**7\. OUR LIABILITY - WARRANTIES**

When you buy a product sold by Amazon EU SARL, you benefit from the statutory warranty of conformity under the conditions of Articles L.217-3 et seq. of the French Consumer Code and the legal warranty against hidden defects under the conditions provided for in Articles 1641 et seq. of the French Civil Code. See [our Help page on these warranties](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201310960) for more information.

Amazon EU SARL is liable for any lack of conformity of your product or product with digital elements (whether new, used or reconditioned) under the following conditions:

You have a period of two years from the delivery of the goods to make use of the statutory warranty of conformity in the event of a lack of conformity. During this period, you are only required to establish the existence of the lack of conformity and not the date of its occurrence.

Where the product sales contract provides for the provision of digital content or a digital service on a continuous basis for a period of more than two years, the statutory warranty shall apply to such digital content or digital service throughout the planned period of provision. During this period, you are only required to establish the existence of the lack of conformity and not the date of its occurrence. For such goods, the statutory warranty of conformity entails an obligation for the professional seller to provide all the updates necessary to maintain the conformity of the goods.

You have the right to choose between repairing or replacing the goods within thirty days of your request, free of charge and without major inconvenience to you.

The warranty of any product repaired under the statutory warranty of conformity shall be extended by six (6) months.

If you ask for the goods to be repaired, but are forced to accept their replacement, the statutory warranty of conformity shall be renewed for a period of two years from the date the product is replaced.

You can obtain a reduction in the purchase price and keep the product, or terminate the contract and get a full refund against return of the product, if:

(i) The professional seller refuses to repair or replace the product;

(ii) The repair or replacement of the product takes place after a period of thirty days;

(iii) The repair or replacement of the product causes a major inconvenience to you, particularly if you have to bear the costs of returning or removing the non-conforming product, or if you bear the costs of installing the repaired or replacement product;

(iv) The non-conformity of the product persists despite the seller's unsuccessful attempt to bring it into compliance.

You are also entitled to a reduction in the price of the product or the termination of the contract when the lack of conformity is so serious that it justifies an immediate reduction in the price or termination of the contract. In such case, you are not required to request the repair or replacement of the product beforehand.

You are not entitled to cancel the sale if the non-conformity is minor.

If the product is unavailable for use for the purpose of repair or replacement, any warranty that was in force shall be suspended until the delivery of the repaired product.

The above-mentioned rights result from the application of Articles L. 217-1 to L. 217-32 of the French Consumer Code.

A seller who obstructs the implementation of the statutory warranty of conformity in bad faith is liable to a civil fine of up to €300,000, which may be increased to 10% of the average annual turnover (Article L. 241-5 of the French Consumer Code).

You also benefit from the statutory warranty against hidden defects pursuant to Articles 1641 to 1649 of the French Civil Code, for a period of two years from the discovery of the defect. This warranty entitles you to a price reduction if the product is kept or a full refund against return of the product.

You can submit your request online through our [Customer Service](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/contact-us) to request the implementation of these legal warranties, and the various options available to ensure the compliance of your product will be proposed to you.

If necessary, you can request to be contacted directly by telephone via our [Customer Service](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/contact-us).

The statutory warranty of conformity applies independently of any commercial warranty proposed or offered by the product manufacturer or a third party, who determines the conditions and duration.

We undertake to provide all the care customary to the profession in the implementation of the service offered to the customer. Nevertheless, we cannot be held liable in the event of a delay or failure to meet our contractual obligations if the delay or failure is due to a cause beyond our control: an unforeseeable event or force majeure event, as defined by applicable law.

We cannot be held liable in the event of a delay due to a shortage of stock at the publisher or supplier. In addition, we cannot be held liable in the event of minor differences between the presentation photos of the items and the texts displayed on the Amazon.fr Website, and the products delivered.

We use all the means at our disposal to provide the services covered by these General Terms and Conditions of Sale. We are liable for any direct and foreseeable damage at the time of the use of the Website or the conclusion of the contract of sale between us and you. In the context of our dealings with professional traders, we will not incur any liability for loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of data or loss of profit or any other indirect damage or damage that was not foreseeable at the time of use of the Website or the conclusion of the contract of sale between us and you.

The above limitation of liability shall not apply in the event of fraud or gross negligence on our part, in the event of personal injury or liability for defective products, in the event of eviction and in the event of non-conformity (including if due to hidden defects).

**8\. SOFTWARE UPDATES**

For goods with digital elements, Amazon (or a relevant third party) will issue the following types of updates for digital products you purchase:

* where applicable, updates which were specified on the product information page when you purchased the product; and (ii) updates which are required by law including to ensure the conformity of such good; see help page [Statutory Warranty of Conformity - Warranty against hidden defects - Differences with commercial guarantees](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_gcs_csd_d2_000_1_G201310960_rUoLtc8MAc&nodeId=G201310960&qid=1714997250950&sr=1).
* Amazon (or a relevant third party) may also issue you with additional product updates from time to time including to: (i) offer or improve new functionality, designs, interfaces and/or features; (ii) to make minor technical changes; and/or (iii) for legal or security reasons, where considered reasonably necessary by Amazon (or a relevant third party). Some of these updates might not be necessary to ensure conformity of the product. By accepting the Conditions of Sale you agree to be provided with such updates.
* You agree that updates may be carried out automatically, without you needing to take any action. Where an update is not automatic, it will only take effect once installed by you. You acknowledge that if updates are not installed in a timely manner, or are not installed properly, this might impair the performance or functionalities of relevant products. Amazon will not be held liable for any lack of conformity resulting from your failure to install updates properly.

**9\. APPLICABLE LAW**

These conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (with the exception of its provisions on conflict of laws), and the application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. We both agree to submit any disputes arising out of the business relationship between us to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the District of Luxembourg City, which means that you may bring a claim to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with these Conditions of Sale in Luxembourg or in the EU country in which you live. If you are a consumer and have your habitual residence in the EU, you additionally enjoy the protection afforded to you by mandatory provisions of the law of your country of residence.
