What Personal Information About Customers Does Amazon Europe Collect?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We collect your personal information in order to provide and continually improve our products and services.

Here are the types of personal information we collect:

We receive and store any information you provide in relation to Amazon Services.

* **Automatic information:**

We automatically collect and store certain types of information about your use of Amazon Services, including your interaction with content and services available through Amazon Services. Like many websites, we use cookies and other unique identifiers and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser or device accesses Amazon Services and other content served by or on behalf of Amazon Europe on other websites. Consult the section [Examples of Information Collected](#GUID-45AD78C8-97B0-4FAC-BB81-E55E7DCE1304__SECTION_834D111DCC86437A8336C1F6256B5C5E) to see examples of what we collect.

We might receive information about you from other sources, such as updated delivery and address information from our carriers, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase more easily.

For What Purposes Does Amazon Europe Use Your Personal Information?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

**_We use your personal information to operate, provide, and improve the Amazon Services that we offer our customers. These purposes include:_**

* **Purchase and delivery of products and services.** We use your personal information to take and handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, and communicate with you about orders, products and services, and promotional offers.
* **Provide, troubleshoot, and improve Amazon Services.** We use your personal information to provide functionality, analyze performance, fix errors, and improve usability and effectiveness of the Amazon Services.
* **Recommendations and personalization.** We use your personal information to recommend features, products, and services that might be of interest to you, identify your preferences, and personalize your experience with Amazon Services.
* **Provide voice, image and camera services.** When you use voice, image and camera services, we use your voice input, images, videos, and other personal information to respond to your requests, provide the requested service to you, and improve Amazon Services. For more information about Alexa voice services, consult our [Alexa, Echo Devices and Your Privacy](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GVP69FUJ48X9DK8V) Help page.
* **Advertising.** We use your personal information such as your interactions with Amazon sites, content, or services to display interest-based ads for features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. We do not use information that personally identifies you to display interest-based ads. To learn more, please read our [Interest-Based Ads notice](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=G64JFZVFDY66XG9K).
* **Fraud prevention and credit risks.** We use personal information to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect the security of our customers, Amazon Europe, and others. We may also use scoring methods to assess and manage credit risks.
* **Comply with legal obligations.** In certain cases, we collect and use your personal information to comply with laws. For instance, we collect from sellers information regarding place of establishment and bank account information for identity verification and other purposes.
* **Communicate with you.** We use your personal information to communicate with you in relation to Amazon Services via different channels (e.g., by phone, email, chat).
* **Purposes for which we seek your consent.** We may also ask for your consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose that we communicate to you. When you consent to our use of your personal information for a specified purpose, you may withdraw your consent at any time and we will stop any further use of your data for that purpose.

What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?
-----------------------------------------

We use cookies and similar tools to enhance your shopping experience, provide Amazon Services, understand how customers use Amazon Services so we can make improvements, and display ads. Approved third parties also use these tools in connection with our display of ads. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our [Cookies notice](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=GVASXV5UZ64R4Y25). You can manage your cookie preferences at [Cookie preferences](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/privacyprefs/retail) page.

Does Amazon Europe Share Your Personal Information?
---------------------------------------------------

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. Amazon Europe shares customers’ personal information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries that Amazon.com, Inc. controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

* **Transactions involving third parties:** We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products from third-party sellers through our stores, download applications from third-party application providers from our Appstore, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions and we share customers' personal information related to those transactions with that third party.
* **Third party service providers:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must use the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection laws.
* **Business transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
* **Protection of Amazon Europe and others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our [Conditions of Use](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLSBYFE9MGKKQXXM) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Europe, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

**Transfers out of the European Economic Area:** Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area, we ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection. We rely on European Commission adequacy decisions or use contracts with standard safeguards published by the European Commission (you can ask [Customer Service](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/hz/contact-us) for a copy of these).

How Secure is Information About Me?
-----------------------------------

We design our systems and devices with your security and privacy in mind.

We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.

We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of personal customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may ask to verify your identity before we disclose personal information to you.

Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of data. You can control these features and configure them based on your needs. Visit [Digital Services and Device Support](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200127470) Help page for more information on how to manage the security settings of your device.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password for your Amazon account that is not utilized for other online accounts. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer. For more information on how to sign off, consult the [Managing Your Account](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GX7AZREFL3D5VC2D) Help page.

What About Advertising?
-----------------------

* **Third-party advertisers and links to other websites:**

We show ads from third-party advertisers to help you find and discover features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. You may see these ads on Amazon Services and on third-party sites, and they may include links to other websites and apps. The third parties we work with to show you ads on and off Amazon Services may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising, including third parties we work with and your choices in relation to advertising, please read our [Interest-Based Ads notice](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G64JFZVFDY66XG9K).

* **Use of third-party advertising services:**

We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant ads about Amazon Services and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. While we do not share your specific shopping actions like purchases, product views, or searches with ad companies, we may share an advertising identifier and an estimate of the value of the ads they show you on our behalf so they can serve you with more effective ads about Amazon Services. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can make choices in relation to these uses of your personal information on the [Cookies and Advertising Choices](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/privacyprefs/retail?oCT=ads) page and the [Advertising Preferences](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/adprefs) page.

What Information Can I Access in my Account?
--------------------------------------------

You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history in the “Your Account” section of the website. Consult [list of examples of information you can access](#GUID-45AD78C8-97B0-4FAC-BB81-E55E7DCE1304__SECTION_364C0C44D62C4B86971674A94E5B92FF).

What Choices Do I Have?
-----------------------

If you have any question or objection as to how we collect and process your personal information, please contact our [Customer Service](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/aw/contact-us). Many Amazon Services also include settings that provide you with options as to how your personal information is being used.

* As described above, you can choose not to provide certain information but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of the Amazon Services.

* You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the [Information You Can Access](#GUID-45AD78C8-97B0-4FAC-BB81-E55E7DCE1304__SECTION_364C0C44D62C4B86971674A94E5B92FF) section. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the previous version for our records.

* If you don't want to receive email or other communication from us, please adjust your [Customer Communication Preferences](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/gss/ccp/). If you don’t want to receive in-app notifications from us, please adjust your notification settings in the app or your device.

* You can consent or withdraw your consent to our use of personal information to personalize the ads we show you on the [Cookies and Advertising Choices](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/privacyprefs/retail?oCT=ads) page. You can also adjust your [Advertising Preferences](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/adprefs).

* The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some essential features of Amazon Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Basket, proceed to Checkout, or use any Amazon Services that require you to Sign in. For more information about cookies, see our [Cookies notice](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GVASXV5UZ64R4Y25).

* You can consent to or withdraw consent from advertising cookies on the [Cookies and Advertising Choices](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/privacyprefs/retail?oCT=ads) page.

* If you want to browse our websites without linking browsing activity to your account, you may do so by [logging out of your account](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GQL359FK7DM8294C) and disabling cookies on your browser.

* You can [manage the recommendations you receive in our store](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/yourstore/iyr/), [remove recommendations you don't want to see](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/yourstore/home) (select a recommendations tile for products you have not previously purchased, select View All and Manage, then select the Remove Items toggle), and [edit your browsing history](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/history).

* When you consent to our use of your personal information for a specified purpose, you may withdraw your consent at any time and we will stop any further use of your data for that purpose.

* You will also be able to opt out of certain other types of data use by updating your settings on the applicable page within the Amazon store (e.g., in "Manage Your Content and Devices"), device, or application. For more information, consult our [Privacy settings FAQs](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GQFYXZHZB2H629WN). Most non-Amazon devices also provide users with the ability to change device permissions (e.g., disable/access location services, contacts). For most devices, these controls are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to change your device permissions on devices manufactured by third parties, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer as different devices may have different permission settings.

* If you are a seller, you can add or update certain information in [Seller Central](https://services.amazon.fr/), update your account information by accessing your [Seller Account Information](https://sellercentral.amazon.fr/gp/homepage.html?ref=asfr_sc_topnav&ld=ASFR404Direct) and adjust your email or other communications you receive from us by updating your [Notification Preferences](https://sellercentral.amazon.fr/notifications/preferences).

* If you are an author, you can add or update the information you have provided in the Author Portal and Author Central by accessing your accounts in the Author Portal and Author Central, respectively.

Are Children Allowed to Use Amazon Services?
--------------------------------------------

Amazon Europe doesn't sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you're under 18, you may use Amazon Services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. For more information on how we handle personal information for Amazon Services intended for children under the age of 13, please read our [Children Privacy Notice](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202185560).

How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Information?
----------------------------------------------

We keep your personal information to enable your continued use of Amazon Services, for as long as it is required in order to fulfil the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required by law such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you. For example, we retain your transaction history so that you can review past purchases (and repeat orders if desired) and what addresses you have shipped orders to, and to improve the relevancy of products and content we recommend.

**EU-US and Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework**
---------------------------------------------

Amazon.com, Inc. and certain of its controlled US [affiliates](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202137190) (together, the Amazon Group Companies, or "We") participate in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Frameworks\* regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union and European Economic Area member countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. We have certified with the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Data Privacy Framework Principles. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework Principles, see [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

If you have any inquiries or complaints about our handling of your personal information under Data Privacy Framework, or about our privacy practices generally, please contact us at: eu-privacy@amazon.fr. We will respond to your inquiry promptly. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at [https://www.verasafe.com/public-resources/dispute-resolution/submit-dispute/](https://www.verasafe.com/public-resources/dispute-resolution/submit-dispute/). If neither Amazon nor our provider resolves your complaint, you may pursue binding arbitration through the Data Privacy Framework Panel. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework Panel, consult [panel set up by the Data Privacy Framework](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf).

As explained in our [Privacy Notice](https://www.amazon.fr/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GX7NJQ4ZB8MHFRNJ#GUID-45AD78C8-97B0-4FAC-BB81-E55E7DCE1304__SECTION_684FCD09BAC54BA3A4475C278A6A3C6F), we sometimes provide personal information to third parties to perform services on our behalf. If we transfer personal information received under the Data Privacy Framework to a third party, the third party's access, use, and disclosure of the personal information must also be in compliance with our Data Privacy Framework obligations, and we will remain liable under the Data Privacy Framework for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

You can [review our Privacy Data Privacy Framework registration](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt0000000TOWQAA4). The Amazon Group Companies are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). We may be required to disclose personal information that we handle under the Data Privacy Framework in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Further, the data protection officer for the above-mentioned data controllers can be contacted at **eu-privacy@amazon.fr**.

Our business changes constantly and our Privacy Notice will change also. You should check our website frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.

Additional Information About Data Retention
-------------------------------------------

We keep your personal information to enable your continued use of Amazon Services for as long as required in order to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required by law, such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you. For example, for the entire duration of your Amazon account, we retain your order information so you can review past purchases (and repeat orders if desired) and what addresses you have shipped orders to, and to improve the relevancy of products and content we recommend.

We retain such information for as long as required by law, including under the Luxembourg Commercial Code, for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims, and for preventing fraud/ensuring security. For these reasons, we normally retain transactional data related to orders for products and services, for example, customer name, ordered product, order date, delivery address, payment method, price, and VAT for 10 years. We may also keep limited personally identifying account information following account closure in order to administer these rights and obligations. None of this data is used after account closure for marketing or advertising purposes. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the storage of all personal customer information including information retained upon account closure.
