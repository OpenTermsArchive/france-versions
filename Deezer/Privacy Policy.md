Protection of personal data
---------------------------

We take technical, physical and organizational safeguards to protect your data against unauthorized access, use or disclosure, and to prevent its loss or alteration.

When implementing and improving these safeguards, we take into account the state of the art, the nature of the processing, the sensitivity of the data, and the potential threats and risks.

* We implement and maintain sophisticated technical measures – such as encryption – to ensure that your data is confidentially and securely recorded and used.
* We restrict and limit access to your data – via access controls – and monitor who accesses, uses, and transfers your personal data – via logs and audit trails.
* Employees who have access to your data are required to comply with strong data privacy, confidentiality and security policies.
* Business partners and service providers with whom we share your data are also required to comply with strong data privacy, confidentiality and security contractual requirements.

Sharing of personal data
------------------------

Your data is controlled by us in France (Deezer SA, 24 rue de Calais 75009 Paris), and may be shared with service providers and partners around the world.

Some of these recipients may be located in countries other than the one you are in, and these countries may not guarantee a level of personal data protection equivalent to that of your country. In such cases, we take all necessary measures to ensure that these recipients provide appropriate safeguards, such as the execution of standard data protection clauses and the implementation of adequate security measures.

You can contact our Data Protection Officer through this [form](https://support.deezer.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000057869) for more information on data sharing.

### Service providers

We regularly engage service providers to perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as hosting and storing data, operating and maintaining our infrastructures, collecting payments, or providing analytics or advertising services. In these cases, sharing is limited to the data necessary to allow our providers to perform their tasks, and we require them to protect your data.

### Partners

On occasion, we may share your data - limited to what is necessary - with some of our partners, such as telecommunication operators, media companies or other retailers distributing our offers, music labels and recording companies, or audio device manufacturers. We also require them to protect your data.

### Others

Finally, we may share your data with our parent companies and subsidiaries, with other companies in the event of an acquisition, merger or sale, or with law enforcement.
