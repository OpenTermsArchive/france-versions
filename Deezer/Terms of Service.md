### Article 6 – Intellectual property

The general structure of the Site, the Application, the Deezer Service and all elements composing it (such as but not limited to the logos, trademarks, domain names, Content, and their associated elements such as the photos, images, texts and biography of the authors, artists and/or any legal beneficiary on the Content) are the exclusive property of DEEZER and/or its licensors (notably the record and video producers, the record companies, authors’ rights societies, etc.).

These elements are protected by intellectual property law and other laws. Any use any of these elements, unless for the purpose of using the Deezer Service, in accordance with the Terms, is strictly forbidden.

In particular, any reproduction and/or making available of all or part of the Site, the Application, the Deezer Service and/or the elements composing them (as described above), by any means is forbidden and would be treated as an infringement punishable by law.

Any hyperlink to the Site or Application and use of the “framing” technique (a programming technique that makes it possible to divide browser windows into separate frames in order to display the content of an external website) or the “in-line linking” technique (programming to make one element extracted from another site disappear into a web page, which saves storage space on the hard drive on which the Site or the Application is hosted and makes it possible to hide the initial content of which the element is part from an uninformed user) is strictly prohibited. Any unfair and/or fraudulent use of a DEEZER account (such as for instance aiming to artificially or abnormally increase the number of times certain specific music tracks are played), by any automated processes such as robots and scripts or any other means, is strictly prohibited.

The Content is delivered as digital files protected by national and international intellectual property laws. They may only therefore be listened to within a private or family setting. Any use for a non-private purpose will render the Deezer User liable to civil and/or criminal proceedings. Any other use of the Content is strictly forbidden and more particularly any download or attempt to download, any transfer or attempt to transfer whether permanently or temporarily onto the hard drive of a computer or any other device (music players in particular), any ripping or burning or attempt to rip or burn any file or files onto a CD or any other medium is expressly forbidden. Any resale, exchange or renting of these files is strictly prohibited.

The Deezer User acknowledges that the Content made available to him/her within the Site and Application is protected by protective technical measures set up by DEEZER in order to prevent or limit, depending on the technology offered, the unauthorized use of the Content.

The Deezer User agrees not to bypass these protective technical measures by any means, for the purpose of downloading these files and enabling them to be stored on his/her reception terminal regardless of what that is (computer, mobile phone, music player or other portable music disc player, etc.).

DEEZER strictly forbids all operations of harvesting and mining of texts and data and any other Content accessible on the Site and/or the Application. This opposition covers the entire Site, the Application and the Content to which it gives access. All operations of harvesting and mining of texts and data targeting the Site, the Application and its Content, including by automated data collection devices, therefore constitute acts of counterfeiting unless a specific agreement formally expressed by DEEZER is obtained. The absence of metadata associated with the Site and/or the Application, directories of the Site and/or the Application, Contents of the Site and/or the Application has no impact on the exercise of the right of opposition expressed by these terms and conditions.

#### 8.1 No right of withdrawal (cooling-off period)

Accordingly, no request for withdrawal, cancellation or refund will be accepted once the subscription is confirmed, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws.

#### 8.2 Subscription Term

DEEZER offers a monthly renewable subscription (or for any other term depending on the offers made on the Site or the Application).

This action is irreversible and the Deezer User will not be able to subscribe again to the same free trial offer.

The Deezer User should be aware that conditions (how to cancel, within what timeframe, etc.) may vary from one third-party platform to another.

Certain trial or promotional offers are subject to the provision of payment details. Unless stated otherwise on the Site or Application or in the Terms, and unless the subscription is cancelled by the Deezer User at least 48 (forty-eight) hours before the conversion, any trial or promotional offer is automatically converted into a monthly subscription at the price stated in the offer or, otherwise, at the price applicable to the monthly subscription to the Deezer Service.

If the Deezer User does not accept this increase, he/she can cancel his/her subscription pursuant to Article 7 above; such cancellation will come into effect on the next monthly subscription due date. If the Subscription is not cancelled, the new price will apply to the Deezer User from the following monthly subscription payment due date.
