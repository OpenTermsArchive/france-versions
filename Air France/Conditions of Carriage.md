Article 2 - Scope of application

2.1. General Provisions (a) The conditions of the Contract of Carriage are the conditions to which the Passenger's Ticket refers. Subject to the provisions of Article 2.2 below, these General Conditions of Carriage apply to all flights, or portions of flights, for which an Air France flight number (Designator Code "AF") appears on the Ticket or on the corresponding Coupon. (b) These General Conditions of Carriage also apply to free or reduced-fare carriage, except as otherwise provided for in the Contract of Carriage or in any other contractual document that links Air France to the Passenger. (c) All carriage is subject to the General Conditions of Carriage and the Carrier's fare regulations in force at the time of the Passenger's Booking. (d) These General Conditions of Carriage have been drawn up pursuant to the Montreal Convention of 28 May 1999 and the European law in force. (e) These General Conditions of Carriage are available from Air France or its Authorised Agents and are accessible on the Air France Website. 2.2. Charters and Code Shares (a) Certain flights are provided by the Carrier pursuant to a Charter or Code Share agreement.  (b) If carriage is performed pursuant to a Charter or Code Share Agreement, these General Conditions of Carriage shall apply especially in cases where they are more favorable than the conditions of the Actual Carrier. (c) The Passenger is informed of the identity of the Actual Carrier or Carriers, at the time when the Contract of Carriage is concluded. Following conclusion of the Contract of Carriage, a carrier other than the one specified on the Ticket may operate the Air Carriage in question. The Carrier shall inform the Passenger of the identity of the carrier, once it is known. In all cases, the Passenger shall be informed, at the latest during check-in or, in the case of a connection without prior check-in, prior to boarding, in accordance with the applicable regulations. 2.3. The Contingency Plan for lengthy tarmac delays applicable within the United States is that of the Carrier actually operating the flight (Actual Carrier). 2.4. Predominance of the Law These General Conditions of Carriage are applicable to the extent that they are not contrary to the law in force or the rules governing public order, in which case, said law or rules shall prevail. Any invalidation of one or more provisions of these General Conditions of Carriage shall not have any effect on the validity of other provisions, except where the Contract of Carriage could not continue to apply without the provision that has been declared invalid and ineffective, and that is decisive and essential for the existence of the aforementioned Contract.

Article 3 - Tickets

3.1. General Provisions (a) The Ticket evidences, until proven to the contrary, the existence of the conclusion and content of a Contract of Carriage between the Carrier and the Passenger whose name is shown on the Ticket. (b) The Carriage service is only provided to the Passenger(s) named on the Ticket. The Carrier reserves the right to check the identity documents of these Passengers. Passengers must therefore be able to provide the Carrier with proof of their identity, as well as the identity of those for whom they are responsible, at any time during their journey. (c) A Ticket may not be transferred, subject to the applicable regulations in force, in particular relating to package holidays. If a person other than the person who is to travel presents a Ticket for carriage or refund purposes, the Carrier shall not assume any liability if, while acting in good faith, it carries or refunds the person who presents the Ticket.  (d) Certain Tickets, which are sold at specific fares, are partially or totally non-modifiable and/or refundable. It is the Passenger’s responsibility, when making their Booking, to consult the conditions applicable to the use of their Ticket and, where necessary, to take out the appropriate insurance to cover the circumstances under which they might have to cancel or modify their journey. (e) As the Ticket is subject to mandatory formal conditions, the Ticket shall at all times remain the property of the issuing Carrier.  (f) With the exception of Electronic Tickets, Passengers may only be carried if they are able to present a valid Ticket that contains the corresponding Coupon for the flight in question and all other unused Coupons, as well as the Passenger Coupon. Moreover, a Ticket that is damaged or has been modified by a person other than the Carrier or one of its Authorised Agents shall not be valid for carriage. For Electronic Tickets, Passengers must provide proof of identity and shall only be carried on a flight if a valid Electronic Ticket has been issued in their name. (g) In the event of the loss of or damage to all or part of the Ticket or non-presentation of a Ticket containing the Passenger Coupon and all the unused Flight Coupons, the Carrier shall replace all or part of said Ticket on the request of the Passenger. This replacement will be in the form of a newly-issued Ticket, provided that when the request is made, the Carrier has proof that a valid Ticket was issued for the flight(s) in question. The Carrier that reissues the Ticket shall charge the Passenger Service Fees for reissuing their Ticket, unless the loss or damage has been caused by the Carrier or its Authorized Agent.  If the proof mentioned above is not provided by the Passenger, the Carrier reissuing the Ticket may require the Passenger to pay the Gross Fare for the replacement Ticket.   This payment will be refunded when the Carrier has proof that the lost or damaged Ticket was not used during its validity period or, if, during said same period, the Passenger finds the original Ticket and submits it to the Carrier. (h) It is the Passenger’s responsibility to take all measures to ensure that the Ticket is not lost or stolen. (i) If a Passenger benefits from a fare reduction or a Fare that is subject to specific conditions, the Passenger must be able, at all times during their journey, to provide the Carrier's officials or agents with appropriate supporting documents justifying the granting of this specific Fare, and to prove the validity thereof. Failing this, a fare readjustment, equating to the difference between the Gross Fare initially paid and the Gross Fare that the Passenger should have paid, will be made or the Passenger may not be allowed to board the aircraft. 3.2. Validity Period (a) Unless otherwise provided for on the Ticket or in these General Conditions of Carriage, and except for Fares that affect the validity period of a Ticket, as stated to the Passenger when buying the Ticket or on the Ticket itself, a Ticket is valid for carriage:

* for one year, as from the date of issue thereof, or* for one year, as from the date of use of the first Coupon, if such use occurs within one year of the date on which the Ticket is issued.

(b) If a Passenger in possession of a valid Ticket is unable to travel during the validity period of their Ticket because, when the Passenger requests a Booking on a flight, the Carrier is not in a position to confirm the Booking requested by the Passenger:

* either the validity of said Ticket shall be extended,* or the Gross Fare for the Ticket will be refunded, under the conditions provided for in Article 14 below, even in the event that the Ticket is non refundable,* or the Passenger will accept a corresponding fare readjustment.

(c) If, after having started their journey, a Passenger is prevented, for health reasons, from continuing their journey during the validity period of the Ticket, the Carrier may extend the validity of the Ticket until the date on which the Passenger is once again in a position to travel or until the date of the first available flight, upon presentation of an appropriate medical certificate stating the health reasons that prevented the Passenger from continuing their journey and provided these health reasons were not known when the Booking was made. Said extension shall only start at the point at which the journey was interrupted and shall be valid for carriage in the class of the Fare initially paid. If the unused Flight Coupons contain one or more agreed stopping places, the validity of the Ticket may be extended by three months at the most, from the date shown on the medical certificate submitted. In the same way, Air France may, on request, extend the validity of Tickets for immediate family members accompanying the Passenger, subject to compliance with the conditions of proof specified above. (d) In the event of the death of a Passenger during a journey, the Tickets of the persons who are accompanying the deceased Passenger may be changed, either by waiving any minimum stay requirements or by extending the validity period of said Tickets. In the event of the death of an immediate family member of a Passenger whose journey has started, the validity of their Tickets and of those of the members of their immediate family travelling with them may be changed in the same way. Any change mentioned above may only be made after receipt of a valid death certificate. The extension mentioned above shall only start at the point at which the journey was interrupted and shall be valid for carriage in the class of the Gross Fare paid. Any extension may not exceed forty-five (45) days from the date of death. 3.3. Force Majeure invoked by a Passenger If a Passenger possesses a Ticket, as described in Article 3.1 (d) above, which they have not used or have partially used, and if it is impossible for them to travel for reasons of Force Majeure, as defined in Article 1, the Carrier shall issue to the Passenger a credit note corresponding to the Gross Fare (the tax amount may be refunded to the Passenger separately) for their non-refundable and/or non-changeable Ticket, which is valid for one year, for a subsequent journey on the Carrier's flights and subject to the applicable Service Fees, provided that the Passenger informs the Carrier as soon as possible and provides proof of such instance of Force Majeure. 3.4. Flight Coupon Order of Use Please note depending on their residency and/or their destination, the below described policy may not apply to some Passengers and different rules may apply. Passengers shall therefore imperatively consult the "Special Conditions" available on the airfrance website of their place of residence, which form an integral part of these General Conditions of Carriage. (a) The Gross Fare established on the basis of the details, flight dates and routes mentioned on the Ticket corresponds to a departure and an arrival point, via any Stopover scheduled when the Ticket was purchased, and forms an integral part of the Contract of Carriage. The Fare applied on the Ticket issue date is only valid for a Ticket used fully and in the sequential order of Flight Coupons, for the specified journey and on the specified dates.   (b) Except in case of Force Majeure, any non-compliant use by the Passenger (for example, if the Passenger does not use the first Coupon or if the Coupons are not used in the order in which they were issued) will result in the payment of an extra fixed-rate fee at the check-in moment for the following Coupon (from 30 hours before the departure) at the call center, at a City Ticket Office or at the airport amounting: - for flights in Europe (including Metropolitan France and Corsica) to € 150 in Economy and €300 in Business; - for intercontinental flights to € 500 in Economy and Premium and € 1.500 in Business and La Première (or the equivalent in the local Currency). (c) The extra fee will not be applicable when the Passenger has purchased and used a new Ticket on the same route within 24 hours following the departure of the flight corresponding to the unused Coupon.    3.5. Changes that the Passenger wishes to make are subject to the fare conditions attached to their Ticket and to payment of the applicable Service Fees. 3.6. Identification of the Carrier The Carrier's identification may be shown as an abbreviation on the Ticket, using its Designator Code (as defined in Article 1). The Carrier’s address is deemed to be that of its registered office or principal place of business.

Article 4 - Fares, taxes, fees and charges

4.1. Fares Except as otherwise provided for, Fares for Tickets apply solely to carriage from the airport at the point of departure to the airport at the point of arrival. Fares do not include ground carriage between airports or between airports and town terminals. The Fare shall be calculated in accordance with the Fares in force on the Ticket Booking date, for a journey scheduled on the dates and for the itinerary shown on said Ticket. Any change in itinerary or journey date may have an impact on the applicable Fare. The applicable Fares are those published by the Carrier or calculated thereby, in accordance with the fare regulations in force for the stated flight(s) from the departure point to the arrival point, for a given class of carriage, on the Ticket Booking date. When making a Booking, the Passenger shall be informed of the Gross Fare for the Ticket and the Booking Fees as well as the overall Fare for the Ticket (comprising the Gross Fare and the Booking Fees). 4.2. Fees, taxes and charges All fees, taxes or charges imposed by governments, by any other authorities or by the airport operator shall be paid by the Passenger. When making a Booking for their Ticket, Passengers will be informed of said fees, taxes or charges, which will be charged in addition to the Net Fare and will be shown separately on the Ticket. These fees, taxes and charges may be created or increased by a government, another authority or an airport operator after the Ticket Booking date. In this case, the Passenger must pay the corresponding amount. Conversely, if the fees, taxes and charges are reduced or abolished, the Passenger may be refunded for the reduced or abolished amounts. Should the Passenger not travel on a flight for which they have a confirmed Booking, the Passenger will benefit from a refund of said taxes, airport charges and other fees, payment of which is connected to actual boarding of the Passenger in accordance with the applicable regulations. 4.3. Booking Fees Charged by the Carrier The Passenger may be charged Booking Fees by the Carrier for issuing a Ticket. Booking Fees differ depending on the type of journey, the Fare and the Ticket distribution channel. These Fees are added to the Gross Fare. The Booking Fees charged by the Carrier, where applicable, are non-refundable, except where a Ticket is canceled due to an error on the part of the Carrier. The Passenger shall be informed of the amount of Booking Fees that will be charged by the Carrier prior to finalization of their Booking. The amount of Booking Fees charged by Air France is available from the Carrier and on its Website. 4.4. Payment Currency The Net Fares, Taxes, Booking Fees and Service Fees are payable in the currency of the country where the Ticket was purchased, unless another currency is specified by the Carrier or its Authorised Agent, when the Ticket is purchased or beforehand (for example, due to local currency not being convertible). Moreover, the Carrier may, at its discretion, accept payments in another currency. 4.5 Obviously erroneous price / Mistaken Fare The Carrier draws attention of the Passenger to the fact that a mistaken Fare may affect the price of the Reservation. In accordance with the applicable law, the Carrier may cancel any Reservation in case of error of display or technical error which makes the price of the Reservation obviously erroneous or ridiculous.

Article 5 - Booking

5.1. General Provisions Bookings will only be confirmed when they are recorded in the Carrier's computerised booking system. On the request of the Passenger, the Carrier shall provide a Booking confirmation. 5.2. Booking Requirements Certain Fares may be subject to conditions that limit or exclude the possibility of modifying or cancelling Bookings. If a Passenger has not paid for their Ticket before the specified ticketing time limit, as notified by the Carrier or its Authorised Agent, the Booking may be cancelled and the seat allocated to another Passenger, without any liability on the part of the Carrier. 5.3. Contact details The Passenger must provide the Carrier at the time of booking or at the latest the check-in, a mobile phone number or an e-mail address where he can be contacted. When the Reservation is made by an Authorised Agent, the Passenger accepts that this information will be communicated by the Authorised Agent to the Carrier. The Passenger is informed that if this information has not been communicated to the Carrier, he may not benefit from his information right in the event of flight irregularities. 5.4 Seat Allocation The Carrier shall make reasonable efforts to meet seat allocation requests but cannot guarantee the allocation of a given seat, even if the Reservation is confirmed for said seat. The Carrier reserves the right to change the seat allocation at any time, including after boarding, for operating, security or safety reasons, or for reasons of Force Majeure. 5.5 Service on board The Carrier shall make reasonable efforts to meet Passengers' requirements regarding the services provided on board aircraft, in particular drinks, special meals, films, etc. However, the Carrier may not be held liable if imperatives relating to security and safety or reasons beyond the control of the Carrier do not allow it to provide suitable services, even if such services are confirmed at the time of Reservation. 5.6 Aircraft type The type of aircraft indicated to the Passenger at the time of Ticket Booking or subsequently is stated for information purposes only. Imperatives relating to security and safety, reasons beyond the control of the Carrier or operating constraints may lead the Carrier to modify the type of aircraft, without any liability on its part.

Article 6 - Personal data

All personal data are collected and processed by Air France with due observance of the [Air France privacy policy](https://wwws.airfrance.fr/information/legal/edito-psc).

Article 7 - Special assistance

7.1. The carriage of unaccompanied children, Passengers with Reduced Mobility and persons with illnesses or any other person who requires special assistance may be subject to special conditions. It is advisable for Passengers to inform the Carrier of their disability or of any need for special assistance when making their Booking. Should a request for special assistance be made following Booking or, in accordance with the applicable regulations, less than 48 hours prior to departure, the Carrier will naturally do everything in its power to fulfil the request pursuant to the applicable regulations, taking particular account of the time frame and the specific nature of the assistance requested. The special conditions relating to the carriage of people as outlined in this Article 7.1 are available from the Carrier and its Authorised Agents, on request, and on the Air France Website. 7.2. If a Passenger requires a special meal, they must enquire as to the availability thereof when making the Booking (or changing a Booking) or within the time limits published by the Carrier. Otherwise, the Carrier cannot guarantee the presence of said special meal on board the flight in question. 7.3. If a Passenger has a medical history or a specific medical condition, it is recommended that the Passenger consult a doctor before taking a flight, particularly a long-haul flight, and take all necessary precautions for their flight to take place without incident.

Article 8 - Check-in and boarding

8.1. Check-In Deadlines (CID) vary from one airport to another. Passengers must imperatively comply with Check-In Deadlines, in order to facilitate their journey and avoid their Bookings being cancelled. The Carrier or its Authorised Agent shall provide Passengers with all requisite information on the Check-In Deadline for their first flight with the Carrier. If the Passenger’s journey includes subsequent flights, it is the Passenger’s responsibility to check that they are in possession of all the information relating to Check-In Deadlines for these flights. 8.2. Passengers must arrive sufficiently early before the flight, in order to be able to carry out all the necessary formalities for their journey; in any event, they must comply with the Check-In Deadline. Should the Passenger fail to do so or should the Passenger not present all the documents allowing them to be checked-in and therefore be unable to travel, the Carrier may cancel the Passenger's Booking, without any liability towards the Passenger. 8.3. Passengers must be present at the boarding gate prior to the boarding time specified at check-in. The Carrier may cancel a Passenger’s Booking if the Passenger is not present at the boarding gate at the latest by the boarding time specified to the Passenger, without any liability to the Passenger. 8.4. The Carrier may not be held liable in any way, in particular for any loss, damage or disbursement, if a Passenger has not complied with the conditions of this article.

(e) As outlined in Article 15.8, the Carrier has informed the Passenger in writing that he or she has been added to the list of persons banned from any aircraft of the Carrier for future travel anywhere within the network. In this case, the cost of the unused Ticket will be refunded pursuant to Article 14 below, even if the Ticket is non refundable.   (f) The Passenger is not in a position to prove that they are the person referred to in the "Passenger name" box on the Ticket.

(b) Exclusions of the Carrier’s liability:

* The Carrier shall not be liable for Damage suffered by a Passenger’s Baggage where said Damage results from the nature of or an inherent defect in said Baggage. If the property contained in the Passenger’s Baggage is a cause of damage to another person or the Carrier, the Passenger must compensate the Carrier for all losses suffered and costs incurred as a result.* The Carrier shall not assume any specific liability, other than that provided for in sub-paragraph (c) below, for any Damage and/or loss caused to fragile or valuable items or items that are not adequately packed, as specified in Article 10.1.2., unless the Passenger has made a Special Declaration of Interest as provided for in Article 10.2.3. and has paid the corresponding surcharge.* The Carrier shall not be liable for Damage caused in whole or in part to Baggage, due to negligence, or a wrongful act or omission on the part of the person who is claiming compensation, or the person whose rights they hold.

(c) Amount of Compensable Damage:

* For Checked Baggage and with the exception of acts or omissions committed with the intention of causing Damage or imprudently and with an awareness that Damage could result therefrom, the Carrier’s liability in the event of Damage shall be limited to 1,288 SDR per Passenger. If a higher value was declared, pursuant to Article 10.2.3., the Carrier’s liability shall be limited to the value declared, unless the Carrier can provide proof that said value is higher than the Passenger’s genuine interest at the time of delivery.* For Unchecked Baggage allowed on board, the Carrier may only be held liable in the event of proven fault on the part of the Carrier, its officials or agents. In this case, said liability shall be limited to 1,288 SDR per Passenger.

Article 20 - Time limitation on claims and action

20.1. Notification of Claims for Baggage (a) The receipt of Checked Baggage without any complaint from the Passenger within the scheduled timeframes shall constitute a presumption, unless the Passenger provides proof to the contrary, that the Baggage was delivered in a good condition and in accordance with the Contract of Carriage. All missing Baggage must imperatively be declared to the Carrier as soon as the flight arrives. Any declarations made subsequently may not be taken into account. In the same way, any item noted as missing from Baggage must imperatively be declared to the Carrier as soon as possible. Any late declarations may not be taken into account. (b) In the event of delay, damage or destruction of Baggage, the Passenger in question must file a written complaint with the Carrier as soon as possible and at the latest within a period of seven (7) days (in the event of damage or destruction) and twenty-one (21) days (in the event of delay) respectively from the date on which the Baggage was made available to the Passenger. If a complaint is not filed within the time limits stipulated, all action against the Carrier shall be inadmissible, except in the event of fraud by the Carrier. If the complaint was lodged within the stipulated time limits of seven (7) or twenty-one (21) days and no conciliation has been reached between the Carrier and the Passenger, the Passenger may file an action for damages within two years of the arrival date of the aircraft, or of the date on which the aircraft was scheduled to land. 20.2. Liability Actions for Passengers All liability actions must be filed, under penalty of forfeiture, within two years from the arrival at destination, or from the date on which the aircraft was scheduled to arrive or from the end of the carriage. The method for calculating the time limit shall be determined by the law of the Court before which proceedings are brought. 20.3. All the claims or actions mentioned in paragraphs 20.1 and 20.2 above must be made in writing, within the time limits specified.
