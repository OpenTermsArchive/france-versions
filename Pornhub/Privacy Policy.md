### **9\. Your Choices About How We Collect, Use and Disclose Your Personal Information**

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us.

*   You can choose not to provide us with certain personal information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of Pornhub because such information may be required for you to create an account, use our products or services, participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes, communicate with our support teams, or initiate other activities on Pornhub.
    
*   The Cookie Banner can be utilized to customize your cookie preferences. The Cookie Banner will record when you have consented to our cookies. For logged-in users, we will ask for consent once a year or when we have major changes to our cookies, to ensure you stay up to date with changes to our cookies and Privacy Notice. For non-logged in users, your Cookie Banner selection will be kept only for the specific session.

Strictly necessary cookies cannot be disabled, nor can the tool be used to block cookies on third party websites linked from our website. You can access the Cookie Banner anytime by clicking on the ‘Manage cookies’ option that is located at the footer of Pornhub.
    
*   Where we provide personalised services, we may analyse the information you supply, as well as your activity on Pornhub so that we can offer a more relevant, tailored service.

If you later choose to have an account with us, you will have to sign up for a new account as none of the information you previously provided or saved within your account will have been saved.
    

### **10\. California Rights and Choices**

As of January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), provides California residents (“Consumer(s)”) certain rights with respect to their personal information, as this term is defined under the CCPA. In addition to the rights that we state under this Privacy Notice, and subject to the exceptions found under the CCPA, Consumers have the right to:

•      Opt-out of the sale of their personal information, should we sell their personal information;

•      Be informed of certain information concerning our collection and use of their personal information;

•      Request that we delete certain personal information we collected from them;

•      Appoint an agent to exercise their rights provided for by the CCPA, provided that a duly executed notarized power of attorney is presented and provided that the agent has information deemed sufficient to allow us to verify the identity of the Consumer in question and to locate his/her information in our systems;

•      Not be subjected to discrimination for the exercise of these rights. We will not deny California residents the use of our service, neither will we provide a different level or quality or services for exercising any of their CCPA rights, unless as permitted under the CCPA.

Pornhub does not sell, nor has it sold in the past twelve (12) months personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration. We may however disclose certain personal information with third parties, service providers and entities within our corporate group to enable them to perform certain services on our behalf, and namely to make Pornhub function properly, as further described in the section above titled _Disclosure of Your Personal Information_. 

We respect California residents’ right to exclude personal information from such sharing arrangements and grant them the option to opt-out of any future sale of their personal information. If you are a Registered User and the CCPA is applicable to you and you would like to exercise your rights, please use the buttons at the bottom of this page or email us at [support@pornhub.com](mailto:support@pornhub.com)  with the email subject line “CCPA Request”.

In either case you will need to provide the following information to verify your identity and enable us to locate your information in our systems: your username and email address that you used to create an account with us, as well as any other information which we may reasonably request for us to verify your identity. We may require you verify that you have access to your account and/or email account that you used to register with us.

You can designate an agent to make a request by executing a notarized power of attorney to have that person act on your behalf and providing that person with the information listed above that allows us to verify your identity and locate your information. Alternatively, you will need to directly confirm your identity with us using the methods described above, sign an authorization for the agent to act on your behalf and provide us with confirmation that you have done so.

### **11\. Resident’s Rights – Jurisdictions in the United States, Where Applicable**

We do not sell, trade, or exchange the Registered Users’ personal information with anyone for money.

### **12\. Biometric Information**

We employ third-party service providers to verify your identity, age, and the authenticity of the identification documents you provide using facial recognition technology. Facial recognition technology creates a mathematical representation of your facial features from the live scan of your face, your selfie, and the government-issued ID you submit or previously submitted to us. Face recognition data is collected by and remains with our third-party providers. We do not process face recognition data.

When applicable, your biometric information may be processed to:

*   verify you are a real, live person and to prevent the use of methods which would allow a user to identify as someone else;
    
*   to match your selfie with your government-issued ID you submit or previously submitted to us to make sure that nobody is impersonating you;
    
*   to help confirm your age.
    

You will be asked to provide your consent to biometric information processing which you may withdraw at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any collection, use, processing, or disclosure that occurred prior to the withdrawal. This Privacy Notice may not always reflect the privacy practices said third-party service providers and therefore invite you to consult their privacy notices and terms and conditions of these third-party service providers.    

### **13\. Notice to Law Enforcement**

The following information serves as a guideline for law enforcement officials seeking disclosure of records. You may serve us a valid court order, subpoena, search warrant or equivalent legal or official administrative document by respecting the following conditions:

*   The document(s) is uploaded, and all required fields have been filed out adequately on our platform for Legal Service Process located at: [https://legalservice.aylo.com/legal/datarequest](https://legalservice.aylo.com/legal/datarequest);
    
*   The document(s) you are serving is correctly issued to Aylo Freesites Ltd by a valid court of law or equivalent legal or administrative authority to us;
    
*   The document(s) is also sent by mail at the following address: 195-197 Old Nicosia-Limassol Road, Block 1 Dali Industrial Zone, Cyprus 2540.
    

We reserve the right to refuse online service through Pornhub, namely in cases where the above requirements are not met and require formal legal service at the above address. In such an event, you will be notified. We may raise or waive any legal objection or right available, in our sole discretion.

### **14\. Transfers of Your Personal Information to Other Countries**

We may share the information we collect globally, across our corporate group and with our service providers and other third parties. Transfers are necessary for a variety of reasons, including our operation and provision of the services stated in our Terms & Conditions and this Privacy Notice to fix, analyse, and improve our Website, products and services. Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside the EEA and other regions with comprehensive data protection laws, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice, as permitted by the applicable laws and based on appropriate mechanisms.

Where applicable, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions,” recognising that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. 

In other situations, we rely on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission (and the equivalent standard contractual clauses for the UK, where appropriate) or on derogations provided for under the applicable law to transfer information to a third country.

For more information or to obtain a copy of our standard contractual clauses, please see the section “_Contact Information_” below on how to contact us.

### **15\. Retention of Personal Information**

We will only retain your personal information for as long as your account is active, or for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we processed it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider several factors, including what personal data we are processing, the risk of harm from any unauthorized disclosure, why we are processing your personal data and whether we can achieve this outcome by another means without having to process it.

Where we no longer need to process your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, we will delete your personal information from our systems. 

For more information on data retention periods, please see the section “_Contact Information_” below on how to contact us. 

Where permissible, we will also delete your personal information upon your request as explained in the section _“Your Rights Related to Your Personal Information”_.

### **16\. Third-Party Links and Sites**

If you click on a link to a third-party website, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This Privacy Notice does not apply to the privacy practices of these websites. Read the Privacy Notice of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for these third-party practices.

### **17\. Changes to Our Privacy Notice**

We keep our Privacy Notice under regular review. The scope is to address any new legal requirements, technical developments or add more clarifications where needed.  

Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to this Privacy Notice, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date version found at this location, so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. If we change anything in our Privacy Notice, the date of change will be reflected in the “Last Modified” date mentioned after the header of this Privacy Notice.  

### **18\. Your Rights Related to Your Personal Information**

Subject to local law and applicable legal requirements and exemptions, you have certain rights regarding your personal data:

*   **Right of access**: you have the right to receive information on the personal data we hold about you and how such personal data is used, as well as a copy of your personal data;

*   **Right to be forgotten**: you have the right to delete/erase your personal data;
    
*   **Right to data portability**: you have the right to receive the personal data provided by you in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit this personal data to another data controller;
    
*   **Right to object**: you have the right to object to the use of your personal data where such use is based on our legitimate interests or on public interests; 
    
*   **Right to restriction of processing**: you have the right in some cases, to restrict our use of your personal data; and
    
*   **Right to file a complaint**: If you are in the EEA or the UK, you also have a right to file a complaint with your local data protection authority.
    

If we ask for your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. Note that, in that case, you may no longer able to use several functionalities on Pornhub or access Pornhub in some cases.

You can exercise your rights of access or deletion of your data by following the dedicated links in the section “_Manage Your Personal Data_” below. You can send an e-mail at [support@pornhub.com](mailto:support@pornhub.com) to exercise your rights to Rectification, Object, Restriction of Processing, or to request us to help you with the process. Please note that we have one (1) month to respond to your request. 

Prior to processing an access or deletion request of your data, we will need to verify your identity and ensure your right to access or delete the information. This is an appropriate and reasonable security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it or deleted in an unauthorized way. 

Please note that unless you have created an account with us, we may not have sufficient information to identify you and therefore may not be able to respond to your request. Additionally, in some cases, to adequately verify your identity or your authorization to make the request, we may require you to provide additional information.

Note that some requests to delete certain personal information will require the deletion of your user account as the provision of user accounts are inextricably linked to the processing of certain personal information (e.g., your e-mail address). If you delete your account, your personal data and all account related information including, but not limited to, user profile data, sharing data and any data or content specifically associated with your account will no longer be accessible. If, after deleting your account, you wish to have an account with us in the future, you will have to sign up for a new account.
