Specifically, we process internet protocol (IP) address information and we set cookies as explained below in the section on _Cookies and Automatic Data Collection Technologies_ and as described in our [Cookie Notice](https://www.youporn.com/information/cookie-notice/).
    
*   **Identifiers:** Some users may be asked to provide identifiers (including government-issued photo identification as well as other documentation) to verify that they are over the age of majority required to have access to Youporn and to view the content. In such cases, this information is processed by trusted third party age verification service providers. This Privacy Notice does not apply to the privacy practices of these third-party age verification service providers. Read the privacy terms and conditions of these third-party service providers carefully.
    

Persons who choose to create an account on Youporn (“**Registered Users**”): we process the same categories of information described above for Unregistered Users, and additionally the following information:

*   **Contact Information:** We process usernames and email addresses. If you choose to register through a third-party platform, we will collect certain personal information from those platforms.
    
*   **User Submitted Personal Information:** We process information you submit to personalize your account or for a specific function, for example your date of birth, age, gender, your interests, preferences, feedback, survey responses, your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties, and your communication preferences, as well as any other information which you voluntarily provide to us at your direction for a specific function.
    
*   **Identifiers and Biometric Information:** You may be asked to provide identifiers (including government-issued photo identification as well as other documentation) to verify your identity and that you are over the age of majority required to access Youporn and to view the content. We also process biometric information to verify the authenticity of the identifiers you provide us while registering to Youporn, as further explained in the section “_Biometric Information_” below. This information is processed by trusted third party age verification service providers.

User contributions are governed by the Youporn Terms of Service found at [/info/terms](https://www.youporn.com/info/terms).

We may process your data to produce and share aggregated insights that do not directly or indirectly identify you and are not associated with you. Such aggregate information is not personal information.

Youporn is forbidden of access to persons under the age of 18 and the applicable age of majority in the jurisdiction from which Youporn is accessed (“**minors**”), and we therefore prohibit minors from using Youporn. As indicated throughout this Privacy Notice, some users may be asked to provide some information to us and our service providers to verify that you are over the age of majority required to have access to Youporn and to view the content. We do not knowingly process personal information from minors. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor who has provided us with personal information, then please contact us at [support@youporn.com](mailto:support@youporn.com) to have that minor’s personal information deleted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us.

*   You can choose not to provide us with certain personal information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of Youporn because such information may be required for you to register as a member; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on Youporn.

9\. California Rights and Choices
---------------------------------

As of January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides California residents (“Consumer(s)”) certain rights with respect to their personal information, as this term is defined under the CCPA. In addition to the rights that we state under this Privacy Notice, and subject to the exceptions found under the CCPA, Consumers have the right to:

*   Opt-out of the sale of their personal information, should we sell their personal information;
    
*   Be informed of certain information concerning our collection and use of their personal information;
    
*   Request that we delete certain personal information we collected from them;
    
*   Appoint an agent to exercise their rights provided for by the CCPA, provided that a duly executed notarized power of attorney is presented and provided that the agent has information deemed sufficient to allow us to verify the identity of the Consumer in question and to locate his/her information in our systems;
    
*   Not be subjected to discrimination for the exercise of these rights. We will not deny California residents the use of our service, neither will we provide a different level or quality or services for exercising any of their CCPA rights, unless as permitted under the CCPA.
    

Youporn does not sell, nor has it sold in the past twelve (12) months personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration. We may however disclose certain personal information with third parties, service providers and entities within our corporate group to enable them to perform certain services on our behalf and namely to make Youporn work properly, as described in the section above titled _Disclosure of Your Personal Information_.

Regardless, we respect the California residents’ right to exclude personal information from such sharing arrangements and to thereby opt-out of any future sale of their personal information. If the CCPA is applicable to you and you would like to exercise your rights, please use the buttons at the bottom of this page or email us at [support@youporn.com](mailto:support@youporn.com) with the email subject line “CCPA Request.”

In either case you will need to provide the following information to verify your identity and enable us to locate your information in our systems: your username and email address that you used to create an account with us, as well as any other information which we may reasonably request for us to verify your identity. We may require you verify that you have access to your account and/or email account that you used to register with us.

You can designate an agent to make a request by executing a notarized power of attorney to have that person act on your behalf and providing that person with the information listed above that allows us to verify your identity and locate your information. Alternatively, you will need to directly confirm your identity with us using the methods described above, sign an authorization for the agent to act on your behalf and provide us with confirmation that you have done so.

10\. Resident’s Rights – Jurisdictions in the United States, Where Applicable
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We do not sell, trade, or exchange the Registered Users’ personal information with anyone for money.

11\. Biometric Information
--------------------------

We employ third-party service providers to verify your identity, age, and the authenticity of the identification documents you provide using facial recognition technology. Facial recognition technology creates a mathematical representation of your facial features from the live scan of your face, your selfie, and the government-issued ID you submit or previously submitted to us. Information derived from this mathematical representation, which may be considered biometric information under the laws of certain states and countries, is shared by our service providers with us as further described below.

Your biometric information will be processed to:

*   verify you are a real, live person and to prevent the use of methods which would allow a user to identify as someone else;
    
*   to match your selfie with your government-issued ID you submit or previously submitted to us to make sure that nobody is impersonating you;
    
*   to help confirm your age;
    

Please note that this section entitled _"Biometric Information"_ applies to relevant users who wish to upload content onto Youporn but does not apply to identifiers processed by our third-party age verification service providers solely for the purpose of granting you access to Youporn. Our third-party service providers will store your biometric information according to their retention policies, please consult the section _"Retention of Personal Information"_ below to understand our retention practices.

12\. Notice to Law Enforcement
------------------------------

The following information serves as a guideline for law enforcement officials seeking disclosure of records. You may serve us a valid court order, subpoena, search warrant or equivalent legal or official administrative document by respecting the following conditions:

1.  The document(s) is uploaded, and all required fields have been filed out adequately on our platform for Legal Service Process located at: [https://legalservice.aylo.com/legal/datarequest](https://legalservice.aylo.com/legal/datarequest);
    
2.  The document(s) you are serving is correctly issued to Aylo Freesites Ltd by a valid Court of Law or equivalent legal or administrative authority to us;
    
3.  The document(s) is also sent by mail at the following address: 195-197 Old Nicosia-Limassol Road, Block 1 Dali Industrial Zone, Cyprus 2540.
    

We reserve the right to refuse online service through Youporn, namely in cases where the above requirements are not met and require formal legal service at the above address. In such an event, you will be notified. We may raise or waive any legal objection or right available, in our sole discretion.

13\. Transfers of Your Personal Information to Other Countries
--------------------------------------------------------------

By using Youporn you consent to the transfer of information that we process about you, which may include personal information to other countries in which members of our corporate group or our service providers are located. When we transfer personal information to countries outside of the EEA or other regions or countries with comprehensive data protection laws, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with the applicable laws. Where applicable, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions”, recognizing that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. In other situations, we rely on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission (and the equivalent standard contractual clauses for the UK, where appropriate) or on derogations provided for under the applicable law to transfer information to a third country.

For more information or to obtain a copy of our standard contractual clauses, please see the section “_Contact Information_” below on how to contact us.

14\. Retention of Personal Information
--------------------------------------

We will only retain your personal information for as long as your account is active, or for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we processed it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider several factors, including what personal data we are processing, the risk of harm from any unauthorised disclosure, why we are processing your personal data and whether we can achieve this outcome by another means without having to process it.

Where we no longer need to process your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, we will delete your personal information from our systems.

For more information on data retention periods, please contact us by using the information in the Section _"Contact Information"_ below.

Where permissible, we will also delete your personal information upon your request as explained in the section _"Your Rights Related to Your Personal Information"_.
