Monitoring and Enforcement; Termination
---------------------------------------

We have the right but not the obligation to take any of the following actions, including pursuant to when we detect, or are notified of, any activity or Content uploaded to the Website that infringes applicable laws, rights of third parties, or these Terms of Service. When deciding on appropriate action, we consider all relevant factors such as the frequency, severity, and impact of a violation, as well as any measures previously imposed on an infringer:

*   Issue a written warning to the infringer. Before we temporarily or permanently suspend an infringer’s access to our services following provision of manifestly illegal Content or action by such infringer we may issue a warning to the infringer, provided such warning would not conflict with the purposes of the moderation decision. Examples of misuse that may be sanctioned with a suspension or termination include, but are not limited to, the frequent uploading of Content that violates applicable law, third party rights, or these Terms of Service, or the uploading of Content that manifestly and severely violates applicable law, third party rights, or these Terms of Service, such as Child Sexual Abuse Material or revenge porn.
*   Restrict the visibility or other accessibility of Content.
*   Restrict the access of, suspend, or terminate a User’s account.
*   Restricting, suspending, or otherwise terminating a Content Partner or Model’s ability to monetize their Content.
*   Restricting, suspending, or withholding earnings and payouts.
*   Report the infringer to law enforcement authorities.

We may also:

*   remove or refuse to post any Content you submit or contribute to this Website for any or no reason in our sole discretion, including, without limitation, if any information or documentation provided by you is inadequate, incomplete, or inaccurate or does not allow us to assess and confirm your identity.
*   monitor any communication occurring on or through this Website to confirm compliance with these Terms of Service, the security of this Website, or any legal obligation;
*   take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of this Website.

If we have reason to believe that Content violates any applicable law, third party right, or these Terms of Service, we may take appropriate interim actions (as described herein), to prevent potential harm to our further investigation. In deciding on the appropriate and proportionate course of action, we will give due consideration to the legitimate interests of the impacted User, any other potentially affected rights holders, and our own legitimate interests. In particular, we will assess the nature of the Content concerned, the gravity of the respective violation or illegality, and any indications on whether or not the Content contributor was at fault. In case an investigation was prompted following report by a User, we will also consider the explanatory information and evidence provided by such User and, if available, the reporting User’s submission history.

We use a variety of procedures and tools to identify, review and moderate Content. This includes both human and automated review, or a combination of both, depending on what is appropriate and required in each individual case.

Automated review may include the use of systems which assist us in identifying infringing Content, determining the prioritization of certain issues, and applying appropriate measures. Content may be compared against databases of digitally finger-printed content and other, similar repositories, such as (but not limited to) YouTube’s CSAI Match. Automated review may be subject to further, manual verification, in the context of which Content and measures may be reassessed.

Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone posting any Content on or through this Website. YOU WAIVE AND HOLD US, OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY US AS A CONSEQUENCE OF DISCLOSING PERSONAL INFORMATION IN RELATION TO DATA DISCLOSURE REQUESTS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.

This Website takes a powerful stand against any form of child exploitation or human trafficking. If we discover that any Content involves underage individuals, or any form of force, fraud, or coercion, we will remove the Content and submit a report to the proper law enforcement authorities. If you become aware of any such Content, you agree to report it to this Website by contacting [legal@youporn.com](mailto:legal@youporn.com).

To maintain our services in a manner we deem appropriate for our venue and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, this Website may, but will not have any obligation to display, reject, refuse to post, store, maintain, accept, or remove any Content posted (including, without limitation, private messages, public comments, public group chat messages, private group chat messages, or private instant messages) by you, and we may, in our sole discretion, delete, move, re-format, remove, or refuse to post or otherwise make use of Content without notice or any liability to you or any third party in connection with our operation of this Website in an appropriate manner. In addition, this Website may, but will not have any obligation to, review and monitor private messages, public comments, public group chat messages, private group chat messages, or private instant messages posted by you. Without limitation, we may do so to address Content that comes to our attention that we believe is offensive, obscene, violent, harassing, threatening, abusive, illegal, or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate, or to enforce the rights of third parties or these Terms of Service or any applicable additional terms, including, without limitation, the Content restrictions set forth herein.

We assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or Content provided by any User or third party. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or non-performance of the activities described in this section.

Complaint Handling Procedure
----------------------------

If we take any action concerning you, your account, or any Content that you attempted to or uploaded on the Website, as set out in the section “Monitoring and Enforcement; Termination”, you may lodge a complaint against such decision. Similarly, you may lodge a complaint if you disagree with our decision following a notice you submitted for Content reporting or removal.

In either case, the deadline for submission of a complaint is six (6) months after notification of the respective decision has been communicated to you. To lodge a complaint you may email [dsa@youporn.com](mailto:dsa@youporn.com) from the email associated with your account or wherefrom notice of the decision has been communicated, and the correspondence must include as much information as possible to allow us to investigate your complaint, and an explanation of the reason(s) for which you believe your complaint to be justified.

We handle complaints in a timely, non-discriminatory, diligent, and objective manner. We may reverse previous decisions if a complaint sufficiently demonstrates that:

*   The Content to which our decision related did not in fact violate applicable law, third party rights, or these Terms of Service.
*   Our prior decision to not act on a notice was unjustified.
*   Our prior decision was unjustified or disproportionate in any other manner.

Abuse of Reporting and/or Complaint Handling System
---------------------------------------------------

We may suspend your access to our reporting and internal complaint-handling systems for a reasonable period of time if you frequently submit notices or complaints that are manifestly unfounded. Prior to such suspension we may issue a warning, provided that this does not conflict with the purpose of the suspension or with other, appropriate measures that may be applied. When deciding on the suspension, we consider factors such as the frequency, severity, and impact of your violation(s), as well as any prior measures imposed. Examples of misuse of our reporting and/or complaint-handling system that may be subject to suspension include, but are not limited to:

*   Frequently submitting multiple, identical, and unfounded notices or complaints.
*   Frequently submitting notices or complaints that are obviously unfounded.

Account Termination Policy

Assignment
----------

These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred, or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us without restriction.

Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights (US)
-----------------------------------------------------

This section shall only apply to Users located in the United States of America.

Except as set forth hereinabove, you and we agree that we will resolve any disputes between us (including any disputes between you and a third-party agent of ours) through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and we hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim (defined below). All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and us or you and a third-party agent of ours (each a "**Claim**") shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("**AAA Rules**"). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitration proceedings will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration, by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies, or as specifically permitted by state law. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. However, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms of Service including, but not limited to, a claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable.

If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.

This arbitration agreement under this section does not preclude either party from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and we also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and we retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms of Service, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms of Service.

Neither you nor we may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or our individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. The arbitrator may award in the arbitration the same damages or other relief available under applicable law, including injunctive and declaratory relief, as if the action were brought in court on an individual basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or herein, the arbitrator may not issue a “public injunction” and any such “public injunction” may be awarded only by a federal or state court. If either party seeks a “public injunction,” all other claims and prayers for relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first and any prayer or claim for a “public injunction” in federal or state court stayed until the arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can adjudicate the party’s claim or prayer for “public injunctive relief.” In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.

If any provision of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this section of the Terms of Service will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Terms of Service. This Section of the Terms will survive the termination of your relationship with us.

Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights (EU)
-----------------------------------------------------

This section shall only apply to Users located in the European Union.

We cooperate with out-of-court dispute settlement bodies (“**Dispute Settlement Bodies**”) that have been certified in accordance with Art. 21(3) of the DSA. The European Commission publishes a list of these bodies.

If you have your place of establishment or are located in the European Union, you have the right to select a Dispute Settlement Body to assist in resolving disputes relating to decisions previously taken by us regarding Content uploaded by you, or notices you submitted to us. This includes cases in which complaints have remained unresolved by our internal complaint-handling system, as described in section “Complaint Handling Procedure”.

We reserve the right to refuse to cooperate with your selected Dispute Settlement Body if:

*   A dispute has already been resolved or is already subject to an ongoing procedure before a competent court of relevant jurisdiction, or before another Dispute Settlement Body.
*   The Dispute Settlement Body has been contacted after the six-month period from notification to you of our decision has lapsed, and you have not previously filed a complaint through our internal complaint-handling system over a particular issue.

Any decisions taken by Dispute Settlement Bodies shall not be binding on either you or us.

We are neither willing nor obligated to participate in dispute resolution proceedings with consumers before a consumer arbitration board under the EU Directive on Consumer ADR.
